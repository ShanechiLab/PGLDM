  Implementation of the semi-definite convex optimization solution for fitting
  noise statistics (equations (12) and (13)).

  Args:
    params: dict. Parameters identified by PG-LDS-ID or PLDSID.
    handle_RS: string. One of ['L0G_omit_RS', 'L0G_use_RS'].
      'L0G_omit_RS': Omit R and S when recomputing L0 and G (based on equation (13)).
      'L0G_use_RS': Include R and S when recomputing L0 and G (based on equation (13)).
    saveRS: bool. Irrespective of handle_RS setting, include the resulting R and
      S in the parameters.
    solver: cvxpy.SCS (default) | cvxpy.MOSEK | cvxpy.CVXOPT. See inline comment
      above for more information.
    enforce_R_pd: bool. Default True. Enforce learned R is positive definite.
      Only relevant for model_type='DT' (see below).
    enforce_symmetric: bool. Default True. Add additional constraints for all
      covariance matrices to be symmetric.
    model_type: str one of ['DT', 'CT']. Whether the primary signal time-series
      that is being modeled is discrete or continuous-valued. Default is 'DT'.

  Returns:
    A dictionary of parameters.
