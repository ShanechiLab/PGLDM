# PGLDM
Python implementation of PGLDM (prioritized generalized-linear dynamical modeling). PGLDM is a multi-step analytical subspace identification algorithm for learning a generalized-linear dynamical model that explicitly models shared and private dynamics between two generalized-linear time-series.

More information about the algorithm can be found in our manuscript below.
